            <h2>Soils:</h2>
            <p>Soil is the mixture of rock debris and
organic materials which develop on the earth’s
surface. The major factors affecting the
formation of soil are relief, parent material,
climate, vegetation and other life-forms and
time. Besides these, human activities also
influence it to a large extent. Components of
the soil are mineral particles, humus, water and
air. The actual amount of each of these depend
upon the type of soil. Some soils are deficient
in one or more of these, while there are some
others that have varied combinations</p><hr>
            
            <h2> CLASSIFICATION OF SOILS</h2> 
            <p>On the basis of genesis, colour,
composition and location, the soils of India
have been classified into:<br>
                
(i) Alluvial soils<br>
(ii) Black soils<br>
(iii) Red and Yellow soils<br>
(iv) Laterite soils<br>
(v) Arid soils<br>
(vi) Saline soils<br>
(vii) Peaty soils<br>
(viii) Forest soils.</p><hr>
            
            <h2>Alluvial Soils</h2>
            <p>Alluvial soils are widespread in the northern
plains and the river valleys. These soils cover
about 40 per cent of the total area of the
country. They are depositional soils,
transported and deposited by rivers and
streams. Through a narrow corridor in
Rajasthan, they extend into the plains of
Gujarat. In the Peninsular region, they are
found in deltas of the east coast and in the river
valleys.</p>
            <img src="alluvial_soil.webp" width=50%><hr>
            
            
        <h2>Black Soil</h2>
            <p>Black soil covers most of the Deccan Plateau
which includes parts of Maharashtra, Madhya
Pradesh, Gujarat, Andhra Pradesh and some
parts of Tamil Nadu. In the upper reaches of
the Godavari and the Krishna, and the north western part of the Deccan Plateau, the black
soil is very deep. These soils are also known as
the ‘Regur Soil’ or the ‘Black Cotton Soil’. The
black soils are generally clayey, deep and
impermeable. They swell and become sticky
when wet and shrink when dried. So, during
the dry season, these soil develop wide cracks.
Thus, there occurs a kind of ‘self ploughing’.
Because of this character of slow absorption
and loss of moisture, the black soil retains the
moisture for a very long time, which helps the
crops, especially, the rain fed ones, to sustain
even during the dry season.Chemically, the black soils are rich in lime,
iron, magnesia and alumina. They also contain
potash. But they lack in phosphorous,
nitrogen and organic matter. The colour of the
soil ranges from deep black to grey.</p>
            <img src="black_soil.jpg" width="50%" ><hr>
   
            <h2>Red and Yellow Soil</h2>
            
<p>Red soil develops on crystalline igneous rocks
in areas of low rainfall in the eastern and
southern part of the Deccan Plateau. Along the
piedmont zone of the Western Ghat, long stretch
of area is occupied by red loamy soil. Yellow and
red soils are also found in parts of Odisha and
Chattisgarh and in the southern parts of the
middle Ganga plain. The soil develops a reddish
colour due to a wide diffusion of iron in crystalline
and metamorphic rocks. It looks yellow when it
occurs in a hydrated form. The fine-grained red
and yellow soils are normally fertile, whereas
coarse-grained soils found in dry upland areas
are poor in fertility. They are generally poor in
nitrogen, phosphorous and humus.

    <h2>Laterite Soil</h2>
            <p>Laterite has been derived from the Latin word
‘Later’ which means brick. The laterite soils
develop in areas with high temperature and
high rainfall. These are the result of intense
leaching due to tropical rains. With rain, lime
and silica are leached away, and soils rich in
iron oxide and aluminium compound are left
behind. Humus content of the soil is removed
fast by bacteria that thrives well in high
temperature. These soils are poor in organic
matter, nitrogen, phosphate and calcium,
while iron oxide and potash are in excess.
Hence, laterites are not suitable for cultivation;
however, application of manures and fertilisers
are required for making the soils fertile for
cultivation</p>

   <h2>Arid Soils</h2>
    <p>Arid soils range from red to brown in colour.
They are generally sandy in structure and
saline in nature. In some areas, the salt content
is so high that common salt is obtained by
evaporating the saline water. Due to the dry
climate, high temperature and accelerated
evaporation, they lack moisture and humus.
Nitrogen is insufficient and the phosphate content is normal. Lower horizons of the soil
are occupied by ‘kankar’ layers because of the
increasing calcium content downwards. The
‘Kankar’ layer formation in the bottom horizons
restricts the infiltration of water, and as such
when irrigation is made available, the soil
moisture is readily available for a sustainable
plant growth. Arid soils are characteristically
developed in western Rajasthan, which exhibit
characteristic arid topography. These soils are
poor and contain little humus and organic
matter</p><img src="arid_soil.jpg" width="50%"><hr>
            
 <h2>Saline Soils</h2> 
            
  <p>They are also known as Usara soils. Saline soils
contain a larger proportion of sodium,
potassium and magnesium, and thus, they are
infertile, and do not support any vegetative
growth. They have more salts, largely because
of dry climate and poor drainage. They occur
in arid and semi-arid regions, and in
waterlogged and swampy areas. Their
structure ranges from sandy to loamy. They
lack in nitrogen and calcium. Saline soils are
more widespread in western Gujarat, deltas of
the eastern coast and in Sunderban areas of
West Bengal. In the Rann of Kuchchh, the
Southwest Monsoon brings salt particles and
deposits there as a crust. Seawater intrusions
in the deltas promote the occurrence of saline
soils. In the areas of intensive cultivation with
excessive use of irrigation, especially in areas
of green revolution, the fertile alluvial soils are
becoming saline. Excessive irrigation with dry
climatic conditions promotes capillary action,
which results in the deposition of salt on the
top layer of the soil. In such areas, especially
in Punjab and Haryana, farmers are advised
to add gypsum to solve the problem of salinity
in the soil.</p>    <img src="salinesoil.jpg" width="50%"> <hr>
            
     <h2> Peaty Soils</h2>    
            <p>They are found in the areas of heavy rainfall
and high humidity, where there is a good
growth of vegetation. Thus, large quantity of
dead organic matter accumulates in these
areas, and this gives a rich humus and organic
content to the soil. Organic matter in these
soils may go even up to 40-50 per cent. These
soils are normally heavy and black in colour.
At many places, they are alkaline also. It occurs
widely in the northern part of Bihar, southern
part of Uttaranchal and the coastal areas of West
Bengal, Orissa and Tamil Nadu.</p>
            <img src="Peaty%20Soils.jpg" width="50%"><hr>
            
    <h2>Forest Soils</h2>
            <p>As the name suggests, forest soils are formed in
the forest areas where sufficient rainfall is
available. The soils vary in structure and texture
depending on the mountain environment where
they are formed. They are loamy and silty on
valley sides and coarse-grained in the upper
slopes. In the snow-bound areas of the
Himalayas, they experience denudation, and
are acidic with low humus content. The soils
found in the lower valleys are fertile.
It is evident from the foregoing discussions
that soils, their texture, quality and nature are
vital for the germination and growth of plant
and vegetation including crops. Soils are living
systems. Like any other organism, they too
develop and decay, get degraded, respond to
proper treatment if administered in time. These
have serious repercussions on other
components of the system of which they
themselves are important parts.</p> <img src="Forest%20Soils.jpeg" width="50%">
