  <h2> Agricultural Loan:</h2>
        <p>Agriculture is the backbone of Indian economy and it definitely comes as no surprise to see financial institutions offer monetary aid to farmers all across the country. Agricultural loans are available for different kinds of farming-related activities.</p><hr>
        
        <h2>Types of Agricultural Loans in India</h2>
<p>One can avail a loan for the following activities related to agriculture:</p>

<p>-Running day to day operations <br>
-Buying farm machinery such as tractors, harvesters, et cetera<br>
-Purchasing land<br>
-Storage purposes<br>
-Product marketing loans<br>
-Expansion</p>
<p>Moreover, these financial aids can be offered in form of grants and subsidies too, which are usually meant to protect the farmer in an event of crop damage or loss of crops.</p>

<p>Agricultural loans in India are not only offered to farmers working towards the cultivation of food crops, but they are available to anyone who is engaged in other agriculture-related sectors like horticulture, aquaculture, animal husbandry, silk farming, apiculture and floriculture.</p><hr>
        
    <h2>National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development (NABARD)</h2>
        <p>In India, all premier banking and financial organisations, at all levels, offer a great deal of financial help to farmers. However, this trend of boosting the rural economy and agriculture through financial credit was started by the National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development (NABARD) back in the early 1980s. When it comes to credit in the field of agriculture, all other banks throughout the country fall under the purview of the NABARD.</p>
        <p>
        This financial institution is working in conjunction with the Government of India to boost agriculture sector. It is credited with several innovative schemes that have immensely aided the farmers throughout the country. The most notable scheme launched by the NABARD is the Kisan Credit Card (KCC).</p><hr>
        
   <h2>Kisan Credit Card Scheme</h2>  
        <p>The Kisan Credit Card is a scheme launched by the Indian banks back in 1998, as a way to fulfill the financial necessities of the agricultural sector. This is done by giving monetary support to farmers, which in turn comes with various features and benefits. The quantum of the loan depends on several factors like cost of cultivation, farm maintenance cost, et cetera.

This has been particularly beneficial for those farmers who are not aware of the banking practices. Moreover, it is meant to protect farmers from harsh and informal creditors, which may land them in a massive debt.

The farmers can use the KCC card to withdraw funds for the purpose of crop production and domestic requirements.</p>
